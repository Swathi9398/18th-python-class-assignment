1. write a program to print the grade of a student based on the marks obtained. 



sub1=int(input("Enter marks of the first subject: "))
sub2=int(input("Enter marks of the second subject: "))
sub3=int(input("Enter marks of the third subject: "))
sub4=int(input("Enter marks of the fourth subject: "))
sub5=int(input("Enter marks of the fifth subject: "))
avg=(sub1+sub2+sub3+sub4+sub4)/5
if(avg>=90):
    print("Grade: A")
elif(avg>=80 and avg<90):
    print("Grade: B")
elif(avg>=70 and avg<80):
    print("Grade: C")
elif(avg>=60 and avg<70):
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade:F")
    
   
2. Write a program to print if the guven year is leap or not.
   
   
year=int(input("Enter year to be checked:"))
if(year%4==0 and year%100!=0 or year%400==0):
    print("The year is a leap year!")
else:
    print("The year isn't a leap year!")
    
    
    
    3. Write a program to print if the given number is zero or odd or even.
    
    
    n=int(input("enter the value"))
    if n==0:
      print("given number is zero")
    elif n%2==0:
      print("given number is even")
    else:
      print("given number is odd")
      
      
      5.Write a program to create a calculator that perform basic arithematic operations.
      
      
      a=int(input("enter the  first value"))
      b=int(input("enter the second value"))
      print("a+b=",a+b)
      print("a-b=",a-b)
      print("a*b=",a*b)
      print("a/b=",a/b)
      print("a**b=",a**b)
