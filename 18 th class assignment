1. write a program to print the grade of a student based on the marks obtained. 
2. Write a program to print if the guven year is leap or not.
3. Write a program to print if the given number is zero or odd or even.
4. Write a program to check the strength of a password.(please provide different rules for the password)
5.Write a program to create a calculator that perform basic arithematic operations.


1. Code

marks=int(input("Enter marks of a student"))
if(marks>90 and marks<=100):
  print("Grade:O")
elif(marks>80 and marks<=90):
  print("Grade:A")
elif(marks>=65 and marks<80):
  print("Grade:B")
elif(marks>=55 and marks<65):
  print("Grade:C")
elif(marks>=45 and marks<55):
  print("Grade:D")
elif(marks>=35 and marks<45):
  print("Grade:E")
elif(marks>=0 and marks<35):
  print("Grade:Fail")
else:
  print("Marks should be between 0 and 100")

2.Code

year=int(input("Enter a year to check whether it is Leap year or not"))
if(year%100==0):
  if(year%400==0):
    print("The given year ",year," is Leap year")
  else:
    print("The given year ",year," is not a Leap year")
else:
  if(year%4==0):
    print("The given year ",year," is Leap year")
  else:
    print("The given year ",year," is not a Leap year")

--------------------
3.Code

number=int(input("enter a number"))
if(number==0):
  print("Number is Zero")
elif(number%2==0):
  print("Number is Even")
elif(number%2!=0):
  print("Number is Odd")
else:
  print("Number is not an Integer")

------------------
4.Code

print("A password should follow the given rules")
print("1.The length of the password must be greater than 12 characters")
print("2.It consists of atleast one uppercase letter , one lowercase letter , a numbers  and a symbol")
print("3.Not a word that can be found in a dictionary or the name of a person, character, product")
pass=input("Based on the above criteria ,enter your password")
upper=false
digit=false
symbol=false
lower=false
list="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
for i in range(len(pass)):
  if(pass[i].islower()):
      lower=true
  if(pass[i].isupper()):
      upper=true
  if(pass[i].isdigit()):
      digit=true
  if(pass[i] not in list):
      symbol=true
if(lower and upper and symbol and digit):
  print("The password is Strong")
else:
  print("The password is Weak")

5.Code

print("1.Addition 2.Substraction 3.Multiplication 4.Division 5.Modulo division")
op=int(input("Select an operation from 1 to 5"))
a=int(input("Enter a value:"))
b=int(input("Enter another value:"))
if(op==1):
  print("Addition of ",a," and ",b," is ",a+b)
elif(op==2):
  print("Subtraction of ",a," and ",b," is ",a-b)
elif(op==3):
  print("multiplication of ",a," and ",b," is ",a*b)
elif(op==4):
  if(b!=0):
     print("Division of ",a," and ",b," is ",a/b)
  else:
     print("Division by zero is not possible")
elif(c==5):
  if(b!=0):
     print("Remainder of "+a+" divided by ",b," is ",a%b)
  else:
     printf("Modulo division by 0 is not possible")
else:
  print("Enter valid choice")
