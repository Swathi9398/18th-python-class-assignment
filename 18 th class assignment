1. write a program to print the grade of a student based on the marks obtained. 

#python code

telugu = int(input("Enter marks secured in Telugu : "))
hindi = int(input("Enter marks secured in Hindi : "))
english = int(input("Enter marks secured in English : "))
mathematics = int(input("Enter marks secured in Mathematics : "))
science = int(input("Enter marks secured in Science : "))
social = int(input("Enter marks secured in Social : "))
total_marks = telugu + hindi + english + mathematics + science + social
average = total_marks / 6
if(average > 90):
    print("Overall Grade : A")
elif(average > 80 and average <= 90):
    print("Overall Grade : B")
elif(average > 70 and average <= 80):
    print("Overall Grade : C")
elif(average > 60 and average <= 70):
    print("Overall Grade : D")
elif(average > 50 and average <= 60):
    print("Overall Grade : E")
elif(average >= 40 and average <= 50):
    print("Overall Grade : F")
else:
    print("Fail")
 
2. Write a program to print if the guven year is leap or not.

#python code

year = int(input("Enter year : "))
if(year % 4 == 0):
    if(year % 100 == 0):
        if(year % 400 == 0):
            print("Leap year")
        else:
            print("Not Leap year")
    else:
        print("Leap year")
else:
    print("Not Leap year")
    
3. Write a program to print if the given number is zero or odd or even.

#python code

number = int(input("Enter a number : "))
if(number == 0):
    print("The Number is Zero")
elif(number % 2 == 0):
    print("The Number is Even Number")
else:
    print("The Number is Odd Number")
    
4. Write a program to check the strength of a password.(please provide different rules for the password)

#python

print("The rules for setting the password are")
print("1.The minimum length of password should be 5(included) characters")
print("2.The maximun length of password should be 12(included) characters")
print("3.The password can consists of lowercase and uppercase letters,digits and special symbols(@,$)")
password = input("Enter Password : ")
lower_count, upper_count, num_count,special_count = 0,0,0,0
if(len(password) >= 5 and len(password) <= 12):
    for i in password:
        if(i == '@' or i == '$'):
            special_count = 1
        elif(i == '0' or i == '1' or i == '2' or i == '3' or i == '4' or i == '5' or i == '6' or i == '7' or i == '8' or i == '9'):
            num_count = 1
        elif(i >= 'A' and i <= 'Z'):
            upper_count = 1
        elif(i >= 'a' and i <= 'z'):
            lower_count = 1
total_count = num_count + special_count + lower_count + upper_count
if(total_count == 0):
    print("The password should contain minimum 5 characters and maximum 12 characters")
elif(total_count == 1):
    print("The password is very weak")
elif(total_count == 2):
    print("The password is weak")
elif(total_count == 3):
    print("The password is strong")
elif(total_count == 4):
    print("The password is very strong")
 
5.Write a program to create a calculator that perform basic arithematic operations.

#python

number1 = int(input("Enter First Number : "))
number2 = int(input("Enter Second Number : "))
print("Enter operation to be performed on Numbers")
print("1.Addition")
print("2.Subtraction")
print("3.Multiplication")
print("4.Division")
print("5.Modulo")
choice = int(input("Enter your choice : "))
if(choice == 1):
    print("The sum is ", number1 + number2)
elif(choice == 2):        
    print("The difference is : ", number1 - number2)
elif(choice == 3):
    print("The product is : ", number1 * number2)
elif(choice == 4):
    print("The quotient is ", number1 / number2)
elif(choice == 5):    
    print("The remainder is : ", number1 % number2)
else:            
    print("Invalid choice")
    print("Enter valid choice")
